II) Positioning Practice

1) B is floating on top in place and the item below moves up behind it.


2) B goes to the bottom right. I think the body is the bounding parent.


3) A stays in place but b moves to its bottom right corner, making the ul the bounding parent.


4) At 0px nothing changes.
   At 50px the box moves up and over part of the list is concealed outside of the page.


6) Now the list moved to the bottom left of the page. none of it is concealed.

III) Layout Practice
That was fun!
