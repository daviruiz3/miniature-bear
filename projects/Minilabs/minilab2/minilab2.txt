1. (Q)Make B float to the left and take up 30% of the page width. Notice that it remains below A. 
	Why? 
	(A)Because A is a block element and by default it takes up the whole width of the page.
	
2. (Q)Notice that the background color extends behind B.
	Why do you think there is space above B?
	
	(A) Default paragraph heading.
	
3. (Q) Notice that it remains below B. Why?
	(A) Its not below B its below c and to the right of b because b is floating.

4.(Q) What happens, and why?
		(A) the div f is below f and only the block element recieves the background-color
		
	(Q)Would the same thing happen if you set padding instead?
		(A) no padding would be the fat outside of the element.
		
	(Q)Can you think of a way to specify margins and/or padding around 
	columns while at the same time dividing columns by percentage of the available width? 
	margin and padding can be set to zero and width can be set to the desired size.
	
	(Q)How would you restrict the amount of space the two columns take up, so that they still 
	have the same proportions but together take up only 75% of the available page width?
	
	(A)Wrap them in div tags specify width, takeaway margin and padding.
	
	(Q)Now, how would you go about centering the group of columns on the page?
	(A) wrap the whole content in a div then margin-left,-right: auto.
