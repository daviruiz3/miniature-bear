	<h3>Terms</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt><em>portafilter</em></dt>
		<dd>(also <em>group handle</em>) Locks into the grouphead and directs high-pressure hot
		water through the puck of tamped coffee grounds contained in its <em>basket</em>.
		</dd>
		
		<dt><em>grouphead</em></dt>
		<dd>The gasket into which the portafilter is sealed on the espresso machine.
		Delivers evenly-spaced jets of pressurized hot water from the <em>group</em> (boiler
		system) to the portafilter.</dd>
		
		<dt><em>tamp</em></dt>
		<dd>A handheld circular, flat-bottomed press used for compacting grounds into the
		portafilter. (Also, as a verb, the act of using the tool to this end.)</dd>
		
		<dt><em>puck</em></dt>
		<dd>The mass of compacted grounds inside the portafilter basket, so called due to
		its hockey-puck-like shape (which is often evident when disposing of the used
		grounds).</dd>
		
		<dt><em>grounds</em></dt>
		<dd>Granular, almost powdery ground-up roasted coffee beans through which hot,
		pressurized water is forced to extract espresso.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Grind the beans.</strong> The grinder should be adjusted so that the grounds are very
			slightly granular, just short of a powder. <em>Dose</em> (grind) roughly 10 grams per
			1-ounce shot, adjusting up or down by 1 gram per tenth of an ounce.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Tamp the grounds.</strong> Using your finger, evenly distribute the grounds in the
			portafilter, so that there is even depth and density of grounds throughout.
			Level the grounds to the top of the portafilter, then discard the excess.
			Using your tamp, apply 30 lbs of pressure straight down onto the grounds to
			evenly compact them, then twist slightly as you release to settle any weak
			spots.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Pull the shot.</strong> “Pull” comes from the original lever-actuated machines;
			nowadays you’ll simply press a button. From the time you press the button to
			the time the stream begins to diminish should total 25 to 33 seconds.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				If the shot is too long, your grind may be too fine or your tamp too
				compact.
				</li>
				<li>If it is too short, your grind may be too coarse or your tamp too loose.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Adjust accordingly and pull several more test shots until you achieve the
			correct timing.</p>
			<p id="note">
			<strong>Note:</strong> Once you’ve achieved the correct timing, withdrawing the shot glass
			early will yield a more bitter <em>ristretto</em> shot.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Serve promptly.</strong> As soon as the temperature of the brewed espresso drops by
		just a few degrees, its fragile sugars begin to break down and the aromatics
		in the top foamy layer (the <em>crema</em>) begin to fall into the lower layers and
		are destroyed by the acids in the coffee.</p>

		<p>Because of this, a shot must be used within 30 seconds after it is brewed for
		its complex sweet and bitter flavors, and multi-layered texture, to be
		retained. (The fat in milk helps to preserve the sugars, which is why
		espresso is paired so nicely with milk.)</p></li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Notes &amp; Tips</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Proper brew pressure should be <strong>8 to 10 bars.</strong> Higher pressure intensifies the
		flavors.</li>

		<li>Proper espresso extraction occurs at <strong>90°C</strong> (195°F to 205°F). Lower
		temperatures accentuate acidic origin flavors, while higher temperatures
		accentuate bitter roast flavors.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p id="warning">
		<strong>Warning:</strong> The water used to brew espresso is <strong>hot</strong>! Use caution when brewing or expelling water to avoid scalding.
